  title: Brightcove CMS API Reference
  description: |-
    Reference for the Brightcove CMS API, used to access and manage your media library. To test API requests, you can use our [API Testing Tools](/getting-started/concepts-testing-tools-brightcove-apis.html). For permissions needed for OAuth credentials, see [API Operations](/oauth/guides/api-operations-client-credentials-requests.html). For information on authenticating API requests, see the [OAuth Overview](/oauth/getting-started/overview-oauth-api-v4.html).

    For additional in-depth guides to features of the API, see the **[general documentation](/cms/index.html)**.

    description: |-
      Clear_sources endpoints expose unencrypted sources to the preview players in the studio for customers who are using [Playback Rights](/playback-restrictions/references/index.html) to protect DRM and HLSe video content. This endpoint is also useful for customers who want to make their protected source files available to 3rd parties or internal users who have access to their API credentials.

        **Important Notes:**
        
        1. Once the unprotected URL is made available, Brightcove and the client have no control over who has access to the content or how it is used.
        2. There will be egress bandwidth charges made to your account when the sources are accessed.
